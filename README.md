# Interpretation Bias Task

An **online cognitive bias assessment tool** designed to measure **interpretation bias** in social and health-related scenarios.  
This project has dual applications:  
1. **Research**: A flexible, web-based paradigm for investigating interpretation bias, decision-making, and confidence.  
2. **Business/Clinical Innovation**: A foundation for scalable digital interventions (e.g., bias modification training) that can support patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Provide researchers with a validated **experimental paradigm** to measure cognitive interpretation biases.  
- Offer clinicians and health-tech innovators a **prototype platform** for developing digital therapeutics (e.g., caregiver support tools, pain management apps).  
- Demonstrate the potential for **AI-powered adaptation** of cognitive training in healthcare markets.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Web-based deployment**: Runs in any browser, easily shareable via GitHub Pages or institutional servers.  
- **Scenario-based trials**: Short, four-line ambiguous situations with randomized positive/negative resolutions.  
- **Confidence ratings**: Captures both interpretation and meta-cognitive judgment.  
- **APA-style results**: Automated graphs showing interpretation tendencies, reaction times, and confidence.  
- **Scalable design**: Easily extended for clinical or business applications (e.g., remote interventions, training modules).

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Fixation cross** appears (focus control).  
2. **Ambiguous scenario** (4 lines) is presented.  
3. Two **resolutions** are shown (positive vs. negative).  
4. Participant chooses an interpretation and rates their **confidence**.  
5. Task generates a **visual report** of results (bar charts, summaries).  

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Collected

- Number and percentage of **positive vs. negative interpretations**  
- **Reaction times (RTs)** for each decision  
- **Confidence ratings** (means and distributions)  
- Aggregate **participant performance summaries**  

The design allows for integration with **data export pipelines** (CSV/JSON) for research or business analytics.

## ðŸ“– Research Background

This project builds on research in **cognitive bias modification (CBM-I)** and **caregiver-patient interactions**:

- Salemink et al. (2023). *Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretation training for youth with OCD*. Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.  
- Alizadeh et al. (2025). *Partner-Caregiversâ€™ Interpretation Bias and Sexual Satisfaction: Gender and Congruency in Pain-Related Beliefs*. Behavior Therapy.  

These findings highlight the clinical and social importance of **interpretation biases** in mental health and chronic pain contexts.  

---

## ðŸ’¼ Business Potential

- **Digital therapeutics (DTx):** The task can evolve into an online **intervention platform** for patient-caregiver communication, OCD, or chronic pain.  
- **Healthcare innovation:** Integrates easily into telehealth apps, offering **low-cost scalable support**.  
- **Data-driven insights:** Aggregated results can inform **clinical decisions**, **UX research**, and **market strategies**.  
- **Customization:** Scenarios can be tailored for specific clinical or organizational contexts (e.g., stress, resilience, anxiety, patient adherence).  

This makes the project attractive for:  
- Academic collaborations  
- Healthcare startups  
- Digital health companies exploring **bias modification** as a service
